# What do you mean by "template"?

A "template app" is all the code required to generate a file (`.apk`) which can be installed onto an Android device.

The template must be configured with the following:

- **"Pay-to" address** i.e. where you would like the app to send payments
- **Price-per-minute** in network's native ETH token (can be zero for free-to-play app)
- **`RPC URL`** for publishing transactions on Ethereum testnets or mainnet
- **`STREAM_URL`** which is the stream of A/V content to be played in the app
- **App name** e.g. "Acme Pay-to-play Streaming App", and minimal copy

# User Journey

The User Journey for a user of this app is:

- **User** installs and launches app
  - App creates own new wallet, checks balance onchain
  - App shows "paywall screen", including
    - Wallet's 0 balance (new wallet)
    - **Price-per-minute**
    - App's own ETH address + QR Code
    - App-specific copy

- **User** taps screen
  - App closes
  - Android notifies User that App's ETH address is stored to clipboard

- **User** sends enough ETH to app's ETH address
  - This can be done in any app.

- **User** launches app
  - App checks wallet balance with Infura

- **User** selects which livestream channel to watch, from the app's scrollable "Channel List".

- Livestream channelID is the Ethereum address of the livestream Publisher.
- App collates address data from [ENS Domains](https://ens.domains/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) (served via [3Box](https://3boxlabs.com/), and configured via [Livepeer Protocol Explorer](explorer.livepeer.org/).

- **User** watches content from the livestream channel over the internet

- Content shown is an automatically generate test source, but contains audio and video.
- The app pays every minute, directly to the Ethereum address of the livestream channel
- App has been tested against eth1 Mainnet, Goerli, Rinkeby and Ropsten, and Matic Mainnet and Mumbai Testnet.
- Content is served from a Livepeer Broadcaster node, set up per videoDAC's [`simple-streaming-server`](https://github.com/videoDAC/simple-streaming-server).
