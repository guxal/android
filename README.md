# What do you mean by "template"?

A "template app" is all the code required to generate a file (`.apk`) which can be installed onto an Android device.

The template must be configured with the following:

- **"Pay-to" address** i.e. where you would like the app to send payments
- **Price-per-minute** in network's native ETH token (can be zero for free-to-play app)
- **`RPC URL`** for publishing transactions on Ethereum testnets or mainnet
- **`STREAM_URL`** which is the stream of A/V content to be played in the app
- **App name** e.g. "Acme Pay-to-play Streaming App", and minimal copy

# User Journey

The User Journey for a user of this app is:

- **User** installs and launches app
  - App creates own new wallet, checks balance with Infura
  - App shows "paywall screen", including
    - Wallet's 0 balance (new wallet)
    - **Price-per-minute**
    - App's own ETH address + QR Code
    - App-specific copy
